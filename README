HyPerCarlo is a Monte Carlo lattice simulator for Hybrid Perovskites. 
This was inspired by Jarvist Frost's StarryNight code:

"Atomistic Origins of High-Performance in Hybrid Halide Perovskite Solar Cells".
Nano Lett., 2014, 14 (5), pp 2584–2590.
 
However, I wanted to write my own lattice simulator with nice classes etc. 
The main reason I wanted to do this was to make a nice, clean code that 
I could use for a wide variety of models extending beyond hybrid perovskites. 
I.e anything with a lattice-Hamiltonian. I also want to eventually let 
users specify their own lattice Hamiltonians in input files, however 
in initial stages these will be hard-coded in. 


Note: I want this model to treat longer range interactions in a more 
rigorous manner so I will need to use an algorithm along the lines of

HyPerCarlo is a Monte Carlo lattice simulator for Hybrid Perovskites. 
This was inspired by Jarvist Frost's StarryNight code (ref needed), 
however I wanted to write my own lattice simulator with nice classes etc. 
The main reason I wanted to do this was to make a nice, clean code that 
I could use for a wide variety of models extending beyond hybrid perovskites. 
I.e anything with a lattice-Hamiltonian. I also want to eventually let 
users specify their own lattice Hamiltonians in input files, however 
in initial stages these will be hard-coded in. 


Note: I want this model to treat longer range interactions in a more 
rigorous manner so I will need to use an algorithm along the lines of
